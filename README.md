# Rescue-Application
RecyclerView, MVVM, RoomDB, Fragments lifecycle, Navigation Components. 
This application is a blend of several applications I use: YouVersion, Intellect and Quotes Hub. Learnt/ understood a lot on the way building it and I'm grateful.
This application helps one journal or take notes. The journal data is saved persistently using Room Database(No data loss). One can also get emotional support based on the feelings,
for example when in need of encouragement. The application does not need any mobile data connection. More features will be added or improved as I continue learning. Viva la androidðŸ˜Ž.
These are screenshots from the application.
